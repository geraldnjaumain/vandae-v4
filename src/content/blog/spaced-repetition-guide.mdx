# Spaced Repetition: The Ultimate Guide to Long-Term Memory

If you've ever crammed for an exam only to forget everything a week later, you need to learn about spaced repetition. This scientifically-proven technique is used by top students, polyglots, and memory champions worldwide.

## What is Spaced Repetition?

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time. Instead of studying the same material repeatedly in one sitting (massed practice), you space out your review sessions.

### The Forgetting Curve

German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered that we forget information rapidly after learning it—unless we review it.

**Without review:**
- 50% forgotten after 1 day
- 70% forgotten after 1 week
- 90% forgotten after 1 month

**With spaced repetition:**
- 90% retained even after months!

## How Spaced Repetition Works

The key is timing your reviews just as you're about to forget the information. This strengthens the memory trace each time.

### Optimal Review Schedule

1. **First review:** 1 day after learning
2. **Second review:** 3 days later
3. **Third review:** 7 days later
4. **Fourth review:** 14 days later
5. **Fifth review:** 30 days later

## The SM-2 Algorithm

The SuperMemo 2 (SM-2) algorithm is the gold standard for spaced repetition. It calculates optimal review intervals based on how well you remember each item.

### How Vadea Uses SM-2

Vadea's flashcard system implements the SM-2 algorithm to automatically schedule your reviews:

- **Easy cards:** Review less frequently
- **Hard cards:** Review more frequently
- Adapts to your personal memory

## Creating Effective Flashcards

Not all flashcards are created equal. Follow these principles:

### 1. One Concept Per Card

❌ **Bad:** "What are the symptoms, causes, and treatments of diabetes?"

✅ **Good:** "What is the primary symptom of Type 1 diabetes?"

### 2. Use Active Recall

❌ **Bad:** "Photosynthesis = plants making food"

✅ **Good:** "How do plants produce glucose?"

### 3. Add Context

Include examples, mnemonics, or images to make cards memorable.

## Best Practices

1. **Review Daily:** Consistency beats intensity
2. **Don't Skip Reviews:** The algorithm depends on regular practice
3. **Update Cards:** Refine cards that are too easy or too hard
4. **Use Images:** Visual memory is powerful

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Making Cards Too Complex

Keep it simple. Break down complex topics into multiple cards.

### Mistake 2: Passive Reading

Don't just read the answer—try to recall it first!

### Mistake 3: Inconsistent Reviews

Missing review days throws off the algorithm.

## Research & Studies

Numerous studies confirm spaced repetition's effectiveness:

- **Cepeda et al. (2006):** "Distributed practice in verbal recall tasks"
- **Karpicke & Roediger (2008):** "The critical importance of retrieval for learning"
- **Kornell & Bjork (2008):** "Learning concepts and categories"

## Conclusion

Spaced repetition isn't just a study hack—it's how your brain is designed to learn. By reviewing information at optimal intervals, you can retain knowledge for years, not days.
