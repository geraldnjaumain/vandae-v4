## Tips for Effective Testing

1. **Try to break things** - Don't be gentle! Click rapidly, upload huge files, enter weird characters.

2. **Test edge cases:**
   - Very long titles/descriptions
   - Special characters in names
   - Empty forms
   - Multiple tabs open

3. **Think like a new user** - Is it intuitive? Would a first-time user understand?

4. **Test on mobile** - If possible, try on your phone/tablet

5. **Check different browsers** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
